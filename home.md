# Intro
The bot Xenon is based around the idea of creating & loading backups of your discord. Create backups of your channels, roles, permissions and messages (only with the Xenon Premium) and share them with other people. Just invite the bot and start now.

# Slash commands

Xenon is now avaliable using `/` on up to date discord clients (web, desktop and mobile). You can still use Xenon with `x!` for now, but slash commands are fully supported. **The docs are slowly being migrated to `/` as the prefix** as well as other minor changes that have not been updated yet, however, most things will work exactly the same.

Xenon Premium does not have this functionality yet, you will still need to use `x?` as the prefix.

# Backups

Backups are used to save and duplicate your server. Backups are limited to the user that created it, but not limited to a server. That means you can use backups to move, or duplicate a server.

Every Backup has an unique id. It's generated by the bot while creating a backup. The id is used to load or get information about a backup. e.g. `p9b3neiq8i4olu56`

# Templates

Xenon gives you access to hundreds of free templates. In contrast to backups, templates are public and can be used by everyone.

Like backups, templates have a unique name. In contrast to backups that name isn't generated by the bot, but chosen by the creator of the template.

Everyone can create templates, if you have a server setup you want to share, feel free to create your own template.
