# Role Creation Cooldown

**You can ONLY load 250 Roles OR 500 Channels in 48 hours**

- Discord has enforced a cooldown of BOTH ROLES AND CHANNEL creation of Xenon
- Merlin and or Staff are NOT able to bypass this limitation

## You can do EITHER of the following:
- Wait for 48 HOURS (best option)
- Load WITHOUT CREATING ROLES [ /backup load backup id: [BACKUP-ID-HERE] options: !delete_roles !roles ]

**CANCELING YOUR BACKUP, KICKING THE BOT WILL NOT LIFT THE LIMIT.**
repeated loading of backups will get you quickly to the limit. eg: you can only load 5 backups if the server has 50 roles
