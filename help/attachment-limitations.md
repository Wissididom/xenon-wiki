When backing up and restoring message attachments there are some limitations enforced by Discord. This is because Xenon can't actually store the files, it only stores a link to each attachment.

Message attachments include any images, videos, or other files that are sent in a Discord message.

- Message attachments can only be restored if the **backup is less than 24 hours old**
- Message attachments can only be restored if the **original messages still exist**
- Message attachments can only be restored if the combined **size of files in one message is less than 8MB**

If you are looking for a solution that actually stores the message attachments and can restore them even if the backup is older than 24 hours or the original messages have been deleted, please check out [Xenon Vault](https://vault.xenon.bot).
