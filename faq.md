# Xenons FAQ

This is the FAQ for Xenon, if nothing on this page answers your question, come and ask in the [support server!](https://xenon.bot/support)

<br />

## My backup is missing and I didn't delete it! Where is it?

Make sure you made it on your **current account**, backups are limited to their creator. This is the result of a [discussion with discord](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412360041300230168/480494807823810590/unknown.png) to protect the bot against abuse.

It is also common that people **accidently copy their backup ID incorrectly**, please double check, especially the difference between an `l` (L character) and a `1` (number one).

If this still isn't the issue, your backup may be older than 11th of April 2019, backups older than this have been deleted.

<br />

## What is the best template? Is there a template for ...

You can **search on the [templates site](https://templates.xenon.bot)** to find the template you are looking for.

<br />

## I donated or bought Xenon pro, but I did not get a role?

You need to **connect your discord account** to patreon in the [settings tab.](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps) If you already connected it, try to disconnect and reconnect it.

Thanks for your donation!

<br />

## How do I create a backup?

Do `x!backup create`, you will then be messaged a backup ID which you can use to restore your server with `x!backup load` followed by the ID xenon sends you.

<br />

## How can I load / create a template?

You can **find templates at [templates.xenon.bot](https://templates.xenon.bot)**, then simply click "Use" to use it.

To create a template, first sign in, **click on your username in the top right, and then "add"**. You can find out more detailed steps [here](/templates#creating-a-template).

If you want to use one of Xenon's **old** templates, you can use `x!template load name`, or search the old templates with `x!template search`.

<br />

## Where can I report bugs or suggest something?

You can **create an issue on [github](https://github.com/Xenon-Bot/xenon-main/issues)** for suggestions or bug reports.
