# Xenon Premium
Xenon is the base version of the bot and is free for everyone. It has the most essential features to back up your server and server templates. If you want to save messages or sync information between multiple servers and channels, take a look at Xenon Premium.

Xenon and Xenon Premium share the same database. That means backups from Xenon can be used with Xenon Premium and vice versa. Xenon Premium extends the features of Xenon and adds some cool new additions. There is no need to keep Xenon on the server when using Xenon Premium. 

> In addition to the exclusive features you also support the development of Xenon by buying Xenon Premium. The upkeep costs grow with the size of the bot. Without the support of our premium users, we wouldn't be able to keep Xenon running.
